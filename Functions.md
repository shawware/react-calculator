# Functionality

The calculator implements the functions you would find on a basic desk calculator.
However there does not seem to be a standard definition of what these are.
So I've recorded the full list here.
You can see what has been done and what is on the "to do" list.

Functions

- [x] Basic mathematical operations
    - [x] Plus
	- [x] Minus
	- [x] Times
	- [x] Divide
	- [x] Equals
- [x] Display current number (while it is being entered)
- [x] Display running total (upon equals or next operator)
- [x] Repeat last operation (if there is one) via Equals
- [ ] Decimal point (for floating point numbers)
- [ ] Overflow and underflow detection and handling
- [ ] BODMAS
- [ ] Parentheses
- [ ] Memory:
    - [ ] Store
    - [ ] Recall
