React Calculator
================

A simple calculator built using React and Redux.

Design
------

The UI, components, containers, actions and reducers follow the standard React / Redux idiom.
A separate Calculator class provides the calculation service via an API.
The reducer maps between the two.

Function
--------

The [list of functions](./Functions.md) will (probably) grow over time and is not completely implemented yet.
